        <h1>The University of Washington</h1>
        <p style="font-family:verdana; color: red">My name is Maddie Lacoste and I attend the University of Washington. I am currently a sophomore studying Psychology and LSJ, with an interest
            in Informatics. I am currently living on campus in a sorority and am involved in a lot of different clubs, activities, and organizations such as Greek Life
        and working in a research lab. Seattle is such a beautiful city and I am constantly looking for new places to explore!</p>
        <p style="font-family:courier; color: blue">My favorite time of the year at UW is during the spring when the cherry blossoms bloom in the Quad.
        Everyone gets so excited to go outside and see them after many months of rain and cold. Seattle in general gets so beautiful in the Spring time; the weather is perfect for 
    going outside on walks or runs, swimming, etc.!</p>
